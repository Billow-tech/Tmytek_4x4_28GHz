## Initialization
----------
```C#
using System;
using System.Linq;
using System.Collections.Generic;

// Import BBoxAPI.dll
using BBoxAPI;

// Scanning device in the same subnet
BBoxOneAPI instance = new BBoxOneAPI();

dev_info = instance.ScanningDevice(scanning_mode);
            
DEV_NUM = dev_info.Count();

// Initial all devices
for (int i = 0; i < DEV_NUM; i++)
{
    string[] response_message = dev_info[i].Split(',');
    sn = response_message[0];
	ip = response_message[1];
	DEV_TYPE = Convert.ToInt32(response_message[2]);
    instance.Init(sn, DEV_TYPE, i);
}
```
## Control example
****
### Running sample code
    Open ConsoleApplication1.sln
    Compile and run
****

## BBoard 5G
### Get Tx or Rx state
---
Use the following code to obtain the current Tx/Rx mode and store it in a variable m. You need to point out which BBox device used by serial number.

```C#
int mode = instance.getTxRxMode(sn);
```

### Switch Tx & Rx mode
---
BBox is TDD based device. You need to point out which BBox device used by serial number.

```C#
int TX = 1;
int RX = 2;
instance.SwitchTxRxMode(TX, sn);
instance.SwitchTxRxMode(RX, sn);
```

### Control Element Phase Step
---
Set the specific channel element-arm phase step : 5.625 deg per step

```C#
int board = 1;
int channel = 1;
int phase_step = 1;
instance.setChannelPhaseStep(board, channel, phase_step, sn);
```

### Control Element Gain Step
---
Set the specific channel element-arm gain step : 0.5 db per step

```C#
int board = 1;
int channel = 1;
int gain_step = 1;
instance.setChannelGainStep(board, channel, gain_step, sn);
```

### Control Common Gain Step
---
Set common-arm step : 1 db per step with all channels

```C#
int board = 1;
int gain_step = 1;
instance.setCommonGainStep(board, gain_step, sn);
```

### Get Temperature ADC
---
Get device current temperature adc value

```C#
int[] ret = instance.getTemperatureADC(sn);
```
